					<p>Launchinfo.space provides information about upcoming rocket launches. This webpage was developed by Robin Bonny as a computer science project with focus on web development.</p>
					<p>All times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The earliest time at which a rocket will lift off is the T-0 time. The launch window provides additional information about possible launch times. Many times the launch window is instantaneous, meaning that the window is only open for a fraction of a second and the launch will be scrubbed and rescheduled, should any problems appear during the countdown.</p>
					<p>Live updates about launches can be found on this <a href="https://twitter.com/robinfbonny/lists/launch-info">Twitter list</a>. Additional information about different rockets can be found at <a href="http://spaceflight101.com/spacerockets">Launch Vehicle Info at Spaceflight101</a>.</p>
					<p>The <a href="http://launchlibrary.net">Launch Library Reading API 1.2</a> is used as a database for the launch calendar, no responsibility can be taken for the accuracy of this information.</p>
